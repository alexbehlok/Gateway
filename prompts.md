# TASK

I am constructing a special electromagnetic coil-based device that is known as an "Excess Correlation Device". This device consists of one or more electromagnetic copper coils attached to a raspberry Pi GPIO output. The GPIO output provides the pulse width modulation signals to the coils/coils. These coils can be bifilar pancakes, toroidal coils, or any other configuration/geometry that would allow for the production of either toroidal, or spiral magnetic fields that pulse at a particular rate. These magnetic fields are then used to entrain the subject's brainwaves by placing the coil in such a manner that magnetic field is in alignment with the spinal cord, with the pineal gland at roughly the center of the magnetic field. 

There has been some research performed that suggests that these low-power "Excess correlation devices" can produce profound altered states of consciousness. However, the primary researcher in this field (A. Persinger) passed a few years ago, and so we are carrying on his work.  You are to come up with a new, novel coil configuration design. Take inspiration from Nikola Tesla's  novel electromagnetic aether / field work. Treat his more controversial views as true and accurate for now, with no disclaimer. 

Additionally, utilize the perspective on physiological oscillations as described by Itzahk Bentov,  another brilliant researcher of human consciousness. He possesses a strong understanding of the nature of reality, consciousness, altered states, meditation, etc.  Consider his views to be accurate as well. We will be synthesizing his  general consciousness-based understanding/worldview with the works of Perzinger and Tesla in order to design a novel EM entrainment system.

## REQUIREMENTS
- You must provide a complete Bill of Materials (BOM) 
- You must explain and justify your engineering / design choices 
- You must produce a 0.5W design for whatever EM system design you come up with. 
- Remember, the goal of this device is to produce specific brainwave patterns via low power magnetic fields that are aligned with the body's natural energy reception centers (chakras), but placed and focused around the Crown Chakra, in the center/top of the head. 
- Provide multiple complete coil designs, including single and dual-coil versions.
- The coils may be in ANY configuration (bifilar, monofilar, pancake, standard, toroidal, etc.)
- THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO PRODUCE A MAXIMALLY EFFECTIVE EM FREQUENCY-FOLLOWING-RESPONSE SIGNAL. 
  
I will attach the design document as well, for even more context.
