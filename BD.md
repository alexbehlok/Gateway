	- See what happens
- Electromagnetic connection to "psychic energy"
- Personal vibrational rate 
- Change in music perception
- Geomagnetic effects on mood/health
- What is known, generally, about crystals, from your perspective (absolutely no background knowledge on this one)
	- Quartz for general energy??
	- Amethyst??

- Thoughts on potentially giving talks / community events periodically either online or in-person
- Is there a particular strategy you would recommend to get more people engaged?
	- Most attempts thusfar have proven futile
- What technical insights into hemi-sync can you share with me?
- Someone joined the group very early on, "Laura". Instant feeling of recognition and affinity for no obvious reason. Almost certainly haven't actually met this person before. They just returned from TMI. Been MIA 2 months
